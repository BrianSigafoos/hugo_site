## Drinks

### Frozen berry margarita

After reading Robb Wolf's great paleo primer
["The Paleo Solution"](http://robbwolf.com/shop/products/the-paleo-solution-the-original-human-diet/),
I wanted to recreate his paleo cocktail of choice the NorCal Margarita but
didn't have any ice. My roommate had frozen berries in the fridge, so I used
them and the NorCal Frozen Berry Margarita was born!

![Frozen Berry NorCal Margarita](/img/posts/berry-norcal-1.jpg)

- 1-2 shots of 100% agave tequila
- 1 entire lime's juice with pulp
- 1 can of club soda water
- 4-10 **frozen berries** (instead of ice in a NorCal Margarita)

Choose your own berries. I prefer frozen blackberries for a tarter drink, but
its great to mix it up with raspberries for something sweeter or strawberries
or blueberries.
