## Ready to learn Go?

Start exploring Go by writing tests with
[Learn Go with Tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests).

Above all, I'd recommend the
[The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0184N7WWS/) book.
It was published in 2015, but thanks to the stability of the Go language,
this is still the best book for picking up Go.

## Linting

  - Configurable meta linter

## Development

```shell
export GOPATH=~/go
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(gimme 1.12.7)"
```

- Versions of Go
  - Use gimme for easy version switching: `brew install gimme; eval "$(gimme 1.12.7)"`
  - Add the code above to your shell init script: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile, etc
- Use Go modules ([read this wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules))
  - You can either:
    - A: git clone the code outside your GOPATH (ie, next to your other code) to use go modules automatically (recommended)
    - B: set `GO111MODULE=on` and keep your Go code in your GOPATH

## IDE Tools

- VS Code
  - [Go modules in VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Go-modules-support-in-Visual-Studio-Code)

## And finally... the Go Gopher!

- [Learn about Go's adorable mascot, the Go Gopher, created by Renee French](https://blog.golang.org/gopher).
