### Ready to learn Go?

Above all, I'd recommend the
[The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0184N7WWS/) book.
It was published in 2015, but thanks to the stability of the Go language,
this is still the best book for picking up Go.

### Watch

### Linting

- [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
  - Configurable meta linter

### Development

- Versions of Go
  - Use gimme for easy version switching: `brew install gimme; eval "$(gimme 1.12.7)"`
  - Add this to your shell init script (~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile, etc)

```shell
export GOPATH=~/go
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(gimme 1.12.7)"
```

- Use Go modules ([read this wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules))
  - You can either:
    - A: git clone the code outside your GOPATH (ie, next to your other code) to use go modules automatically (recommended)
    - B: set `GO111MODULE=on` and keep your Go code in your GOPATH

### IDE Tools

- VS Code
  - [Go modules in VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Go-modules-support-in-Visual-Studio-Code)
