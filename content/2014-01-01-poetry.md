## Our sixth year

    2019-12-29

    Our sixth year
    Laughing together and loving tenderly
    Has been one we'll never forget.

    From a Dubai beach bar to
    The crisp sand of our future.
    Stretching before us vividly in our
    Imagination, dreams, and actions.
    With purpose,
    We turn desires into reality.
    We meet challenges
    With a determined smile.
    From one amazing night, to 6 years
    Of laughing, loving, and passion
    For each other and for life.

    Breathing deeply.
    Committed to always.
    Being present.

    A day. A moment. A kiss. Or many.
    To seal our love,
    Standing before our families.
    A smile. A loud sob. A hand stroking.
    Words of love
    Acknowledging the other's impact
    In shaping our life.
    A future. A hope. A purpose.
    Unexpected directions.
    We dance and dip and laugh.

    I promise
    To stay silly enough to make you laugh
    To listen and offer support
    To be present
    To hold you tight
    To take you on adventures and
    Explore our beautiful Earth
    To grow with you always.
    To help us never take for granted
    Our love or our time together.
    To cherish our love and
    To cherish you for the rest of my life.

    Your kisses fill my heart with warmth.
    They bring water to my parched life.
    Moisture to my scaly, tough skinned existence.
    Those wet kisses with lips parted,
    Full of tenderness,
    Breathe life into my existence.

    Your smile lights my darkest days and
    Reassures me everything will be ok.
    Better than ok, your hugs make me feel
    Safe and loved and valuable.

    I love that moment of anticipation,
    When your eyes sparkle and we grow quiet.
    One of two things are coming.
    A quiet moment of our souls reaching out and
    Grasping each other firmly.
    Whispering how much our presence and
    Kindness mean to each other.
    Holding each other tight in
    Love and passion and emotion.
    Or, you're about to pounce.
    Like a playful cheetah.
    Leaping on top of me.
    Wrapping yourself around me.
    An embrace full of laughter and connection.

    One tap. One kick.
    Two taps. Two kicks.
    The excitement of communicating in utero
    Your mom's belly swelling as much as my pride
    I can't wait to be your father
    To read books to you and
    To help you with math homework
    I can't wait to hold you.
    I can't wait to tell you how much I love you
    And to tell you how much I love your mom
    Why I'll always love the word "tortuga"
    I can wait to be silly with you and show you
    How your mom and I dance in the kitchen
    And to tell you how your dad danced like a fool
    To win your mom's affection.
    One step. One kiss.
    Two steps. Two kisses.
