## Total rows

Get an estimate of the number of rows for an enormous table called "events".

```sql
SELECT reltuples::bigint AS rows_estimate FROM pg_class WHERE relname="events";
```

## Total size

Or get a table of a database's largest relations and their total size in bytes,
total size pretty, and rows estimate.

```sql
SELECT
    nspname || '.' || relname AS "relation",
    pg_total_relation_size(C.oid) AS "total_size_bytes",
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(C.oid)) AS "total_size_pretty",
    reltuples::BIGINT AS "rows_estimate"
  FROM pg_class C
  LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
  WHERE nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
    AND C.relkind <> 'i'
    AND nspname !~ '^pg_toast'
  ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(C.oid) DESC
  LIMIT 200;
```

## More size queries

Get table, index, and total size.

```sql
SELECT
  table_name,
  pg_size_pretty(table_size) AS table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(indexes_size) AS indexes_size,
  pg_size_pretty(total_size) AS total_size
FROM (
  SELECT
    table_name,
    pg_table_size(table_name) AS table_size,
    pg_indexes_size(table_name) AS indexes_size,
    pg_total_relation_size(table_name) AS total_size
  FROM (
    SELECT ('"' || table_schema || '"."' || table_name || '"') AS table_name, table_catalog
    FROM information_schema.tables
  ) AS all_tables
  ORDER BY total_size DESC
) AS pretty_sizes;
```

Or get the size of the largest relations.

```sql
SELECT nspname || '.' || relname AS "relation",
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(C.oid)) AS "size"
  FROM pg_class C
  LEFT JOIN pg_namespace N ON (N.oid = C.relnamespace)
  WHERE nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
  ORDER BY pg_relation_size(C.oid) DESC
  LIMIT 20;
```

## pg_dump

```bash
cat .../<your-app>/.../database.yml
DB_HOST=<from database.yml>
DB_NAME=<from database.yml>
DB_USER=<from database.yml>
DB_DUMP_FILE=db.dump
# -Fc format custom, -v verbose
time (pg_dump -Fc -v -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME -f $DB_DUMP_FILE)
```

```bash
SERVER_USER=<ie deploy>
SERVER_IP=<ie 1.2.3.4 >
DB_NAME=<ie database_prod>
REMOTE_DB_DUMP_FILE=db.dump
DATE=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")
LOCAL_DB_DUMP=$HOME/.../$DB_NAME\-$DATE.dump

echo Fetching production database dump
scp $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_IP:$REMOTE_DB_DUMP_FILE $LOCAL_DB_DUMP
```

## pg_restore

Simple pg_restore for local development

```bash
cat .../<your-app>/.../database.yml
DB_NAME=<from database.yml>
DB_DUMP_FILE=db.dump

# -Fc --format=custom, -v --verbose
# -c --clean (clean/drop database objects before recreating them!)
time (pg_restore -Fc -v -c -d $DB_NAME $DB_DUMP_FILE)
```

More realistic scenario on production or staging server, using a `pg_restore.list`
option with `-L pg_restore.list`

```bash
DB_HOST=<from database.yml>
DB_NAME=<from database.yml>
DB_USER=<from database.yml>
DB_DUMP_FILE=db.dump
PG_RESTORE_LIST=pg_restore.list

pg_restore -l db.dump | grep -Fv -e 'COMMENT - EXTENSION' -e 'master' -e 'rdsadmin' > $PG_RESTORE_LIST
# -Fc --format=custom, -v --verbose, -O --no-owner, -1 --single-transaction
# -e --exit-on-error
time (pg_restore -Fc -v -O -1 -e -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME -U $DB_USER -L $PG_RESTORE_LIST $DB_DUMP_FILE)
```

### Restore specific table(s)

```bash
DB_HOST=<from database.yml>
DB_NAME=<from database.yml>
DB_USER=<from database.yml>
DB_DUMP_FILE=db.dump
DB_TABLE1=<ie users>
DB_TABLE2=<ie accounts>

# -Fc --format=custom, -v --verbose, -a --data-only, -1 --single-transaction
# -e --exit-on-error, -t --table (as many as needed)
time (pg_restore -Fc -v -a -1 -e -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME -U $DB_USER -t $DB_TABLE1 -t $DB_TABLE2 $DB_DUMP_FILE)
```

## EXPLAIN

Add `EXPLAIN` before a query to get its execution plan.
Example: `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 42;`

Add `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for the statement to be actually executed, not only
planned. This is fine for `SELECT`. But, since the query is executed, be careful
with `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE AS`. Wrap those with a `BEGIN`
and `ROLLBACK`:

```sql
BEGIN;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE ...;
ROLLBACK;
```

## VACUUM

Why `VACUUM`?

> In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that are deleted or obsoleted by an
> update are not physically removed from their table; they remain present until
> a VACUUM is done. Therefore it's necessary to do VACUUM periodically,
> especially on frequently-updated tables.
> ([reference](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-vacuum.html))

`VACUUM ANALYZE` performs a `VACUUM` and then an `ANALYZE` for each selected
table.

`ANALYZE` updates statistics used by the planner to determine the most efficient
way to execute a query.

`VACUUM FULL` reclaims more space, but takes much longer and **exclusively locks
the table**. This method also requires extra disk space, since it writes a new
copy of the table and doesn't release the old copy until the operation is
complete.

## Rails console SQL commands

From the Rails console, call `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute "..."`
to execute arbitrary SQL commands:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute "VACUUM VERBOSE ANALYZE users"
```

## Maintaining a Database

Find unused indexes that can be pruned.

> Since indexes add significant overhead to any table change operation,
> they should be removed if they are not being used for either queries or
> constraint enforcement (such as making sure a value is unique).

```sql
SELECT
    t.schemaname,
    t.tablename,
    indexname,
    c.reltuples AS num_rows,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(t.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(t.tablename)::text)) AS table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(t.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(indexrelname)::text)) AS index_size,
    pg_relation_size(quote_ident(t.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(t.tablename)::text) AS table_size_raw,
    pg_relation_size(quote_ident(t.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(indexrelname)::text) AS index_size_raw,
    CASE WHEN indisunique THEN 'Y'
        ELSE 'N'
    END AS UNIQUE,
    number_of_scans,
    tuples_read,
    tuples_fetched
FROM pg_tables t
LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_class c ON t.tablename = c.relname
LEFT OUTER JOIN (
    SELECT
        c.relname AS ctablename,
        ipg.relname AS indexname,
        x.indnatts AS number_of_columns,
        idx_scan AS number_of_scans,
        idx_tup_read AS tuples_read,
        idx_tup_fetch AS tuples_fetched,
        indexrelname,
        indisunique,
        schemaname
    FROM pg_index x
    JOIN pg_class c ON c.oid = x.indrelid
    JOIN pg_class ipg ON ipg.oid = x.indexrelid
    JOIN pg_stat_all_indexes psai ON x.indexrelid = psai.indexrelid
) AS foo ON t.tablename = foo.ctablename AND t.schemaname = foo.schemaname
WHERE t.schemaname
    NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
--    AND number_of_scans < 200
ORDER BY number_of_scans, 1, 2, 3;
```
