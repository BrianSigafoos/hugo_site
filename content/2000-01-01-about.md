### Hi, I'm Brian

I'm a customer-focused software engineer and previous startup founder. I love building products that delight customers and creating a culture of continuous learning.


Since 2017, I've helped make email more trustworthy with
[Valimail](https://www.valimail.com). Valimail stops phishing emails
automatically. It helps businesses protect their customers and employees
from fraud.

Since 2006, I've used sports to bring people together with
[PeacePlayers](https://www.peaceplayersintl.org),
[DUPLAYS](https://duplays.com), and [Playpass](https://playpass.com).
Playpass makes life easier for managers of sports leagues with an online
[league scheduler](https://playpass.com/sports-software/league-scheduler).
It also provides software for online payments, referrals, waivers, and a website
builder.

In 2013, I was named a
["high-impact entrepreneur"](https://endeavor.org/blog/in-the-news/28-high-impact-entrepreneurs-from-12-countries-join-the-endeavor-network-first-entrepreneurs-selected-from-miami-usa-morocco-and-uae/)
by Endeavor Global.

I also played
[basketball at Harvard](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2001/12/the-big-picture-16-2/)
and as a pro in 4 countries.

You can contact me on

I'm also on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12078717-brian) and
here's my [reading list](/reading).
