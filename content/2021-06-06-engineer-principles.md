### Principles

#### Focus on customer value

- Ask and seek to really understand the "Why?". How does what you're building help your customers make progress?
- If you understand this well, you can make better decisions while building.

#### Communicate proactively

- Ask questions in meetings, especially to understand the "Why?".
- Use threads in open channels (in Slack, for example) to communicate and bring people into the conversation as needed.
- Avoid relying solely on direct messages and sub-group conversations.

#### Encourage critique

- Learn to give thoughtful critiques of technical plans. Always focus on the plan, not the person.
- Ask others for critiques of your technical plans, as early as possible.
- Thoughtful critiques, early in the planning process, help make technical plans stronger and ultimately save you time (less rework).

#### Unblock yourself

- Never accept being blocked.
- Communicate clearly if things are in your way, or are slowing you down.
