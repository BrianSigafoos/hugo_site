title: Practicing Scrum
summary: Agile training notes from a Scrum workshop by Ron Lichty.
---

I recently attended an [Agile training by Ron Lichty](https://ronlichty.com/).
These notes are my attempt to digest and process this outstanding Scrum workshop,
focused on delighting customers and team happiness for our Engineering and
Product teams.

## Defining Scrum

[Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) is an
[Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
process framework for teams of less than 10 members. Teams break their work
into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called **sprints**
(usually two weeks). They track progress and re-plan in 15-minute timeboxed
stand-up meetings, called daily **scrums**.

## Ideal team

- 5-9 people (max)
- Collocated
- Dedicated
- Focused
- Cross-functional
- Self-organizing

## Definition of done

- Entire team participates, including Product Owner
- Prior to coding a single line
- Post it where team can see it
- Agile: it can change
  - If the current definition of done is getting in the way or not effective,
    the team can change it at the Sprint retrospective

## Project planning

- Entire team participates
  - Product manager brings product backlog stories
  - Only folks who will build it (engineers, designers, etc) do sizing
  - Others (architects, etc) can attend but only as a resource
- 1/2 day, covering 50-150 stories, 3-6 months of backlog
- Always size stories relative to other stories
- Snake sizing / two-pass relative sizing
  - Ron Lichty's adaptation of the Steve Bockman method, aka
    the [Team Estimation Game](https://www.agilelearninglabs.com/2012/05/how-to-play-the-team-estimation-game/)

### Snake sizing / two-pass relative sizing

- First pass: order all stories by relative size
- Each team member:
  - takes top story from the deck
  - reads it aloud
  - places it to left or right of another story
  - stories on the left are easier, on the right are harder
  - sizing is all relative
  - go with gut
  - aim to get consent from others' eyes, but consensus isn't required
  - if others don't consent, it's an opportunity for discussion and learning from each other's perspectives
- Second pass: start at easiest to find dividing line for points
- Use modified Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100
  - 20, 40, and 100 are just huge, huger, hugest.
    - Don't get stuck on them, they need to be split into smaller stories to make it into a sprint.
- Store snake in order for future sessions
- When new stories arrive that could go into next 2-3 sprints of work, they need to be pointed
  - Lay the snake back out and do more relative sizing

### Product business value sizing

- Product Owner, with input as needed from Architects and Tech Leads
- Use same two-pass relative sizing approach, with another deck of cards
- This time ordered by value to business
- Use regular Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597...
  - Business value for a story can be 1000x more than another story

### Product Backlog Items (PBI's)

- User PBI, aka User Stories
  - Product assesses value
- Technical PBI
  - For value pointing, Architect assesses value, and can bring in Tech Leads
  - As a team keep the codebase malleable, paying down technical debt

## Backlog

- Before sprint planning, backlog needs 2 1/2 sprints worth of stories ordered
  by ROI (business value / points)
- Order by ROI, dependencies, and "judgement" of opportunities to learn by
  consulting with Architect, Tech Leads

## Sprints

- Starts with sprint planning
- Ends with demos to stakeholders and a sprint retrospective, aka sprint retro

### Sprint planning

- Team pulls cards from backlog, not Scrum Master or Product Owner
- Team decides what's the most productive they can be and asks Product Owner if that's acceptable
- Team breaks stories into tasks and estimates tasks in days, smallest 1/2 day
- May write names on tasks

## User stories

- A unit of business value
- "As a [user type] I want [to do X] so that [I get value]"
- Testable
- Fits in a sprint (an epic is a story that doesnâ€™t fit)
- A placeholder for communication

## Technical debt stories

- 20% of each sprint's points, or there will be technical bankruptcy
- Can have separate swimlane or same user story backlog

## Agile disciplines

- Self-organizing teams means 1 leader at a time
- Like jazz: playing together and playing off each other
- Psychological safety is paramount
  - Everyone talks equally, no one dominates
- Trust and respect are key

## Standups

- Daily, 15 min timeboxed
- 3 questions, in context of current sprint:
  - What did I accomplish yesterday?
  - What will I accomplish today?
  - What is blocking me?
- Team moves cards as done, updates card with time spent and time left
- "Fist to Five" vote: are we on track for our Sprint Plan
  - If less than 4's and 5's, it's a discussion on where team might fall short.
    - Project Owner can then choose what not to do

## Sprint Retrospectives

- Team only: product and engineers. No engineering managers.
- Key questions:
  - What's getting in our way?
  - What can we experiment with?

## Scrum ceremonies and events

- Standup: 15 min daily
- Sprint: 2 week duration
- Retrospectives: 1 hour on last day of sprint
- Demos: 15min per team on last day of sprint
- Project planning: 1/2 day relative sizing with 6 months of stories (team and managers)
- Sprint planning: 2 hours on first day of new sprint (team and managers)

## Project Workflow

| Stage        | Product / Overall                            | Technical     |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Listing:     | Epics and stories user PBI                   | Technical PBI |
| Sizing:      | Snake sizing, two-pass relative sizing       |
| Ordering:    | ROI/Dependencies/Risk                        | Urgency/Risk  |
| Integrating: | 1-2 backlogs with 2 1/2 sprints detailed     |
| Planning:    | Sprint Plan, team pulls from 1 or 2 backlogs |

## Focus on what matters the most

1. Delight customer
2. Team happiness
