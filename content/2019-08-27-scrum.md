title: Scrum notes
summary: My Agile training notes from a Scrum workshop by Ron Lichty
---

I recently attended an [Agile training by Ron Lichty](https://ronlichty.com/).
These notes are my attempt to digest and process this outstanding Scrum workshop.
The notes focus on specifics to make our Engineering and Product teams more
successful.

## Ideal team

- 5-9 people (max)
- Colocated
- Dedicated
- Focused
- Cross-functional
- Self-organizing

## Project Planning

- Entire team participates
  - Product manager brings product backlog stories
  - Only folks who will build it (engineers, designers, etc) do sizing
  - Others (architects, etc) can attend but only as a resource
- 1/2 day, covering 50-150 stories, 3-6 months of backlog
- Always size stories relative to other stories
- Use two-pass relative sizing
  - AKA the Snake, the Steve Bockman method, the [Team Estimation Game](https://www.agilelearninglabs.com/2012/05/how-to-play-the-team-estimation-game/)

### Two-pass relative sizing

- First pass: order all stories by relative size
- Each team member:
  - takes top story from the deck
  - reads it aloud
  - places it to left or right of another story
  - stories on the left are easier, on the right are harder
  - sizing is all relative
  - go with gut
  - aim to get consent from others' eyes, but consensus isn't required
  - if others don't consent, it's an opportunity for discussion and learning from each other's perspectives
- Second pass: start at easiest to find dividing line for points
- Use modified Fibonacci: 1 2 3 5 8 13 20 40 100
  - 20, 40, and 100 are just huge, huger, hugest.
    - Don't get stuck on them, they need to be split into smaller stories to make it into a sprint.
- Store snake in order for future sessions
- When new stories arrive that could go into next 2-3 sprints of work, they need to be pointed
  - Lay the snake back out and do more relative sizing

### Product business value sizing

- Product Owner, with input as needed from Architects and Tech Leads
- Use same two-pass relative sizing approach, with another deck of cards
- This time ordered by value to business
- Use regular Fibonacci: 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597...
  - Business value for a story can be 1000x more than another story

## Sprint Planning

- Before sprint planning, backlog has 2-3 sprints worth of cards ordered by ROI (business value / points)
- Team pulls cards from backlog, not Scrum Master or Product Owner
- Team decides what's the most productive they can be and asks Product Owner if that's acceptible
- Team breaks stories into tasks and estimates tasks in days or hours
- May write names on tasks
- Project Owner, if hears team is falling behind can choose what not to do

## User stories

- A unit of business value
- "As a [user type] I want [to do X] so that [I get value]"
- Testable
- Fit in a sprint (an epic is a story that doesnâ€™t fit)
- A placeholder for communication

## Technical debt stories

- 20% of each sprint's points, or there will be technical bankruptcy
- Can have separate swimlane or same user story backlog

## Agile disciplines

- Self-organizing teams means 1 leader at a time
- Like jazz: playing together and playing off each other
- Psychological safety is paramount
  - Everyone talks equally, no one dominates
- Trust and respect are key

## Standups

- Daily, 15 min timboxed
- 3 questions, in context of current sprint:
  - What did I accomplish yesterday?
  - What will I accompoish today?
  - What is blocking me?
- Team moves cards as done, updates card with time left
- "Fist to Five" vote: are we on track for our Sprint Plan

## Scrum ceremonies and events

- Standup: 15 min daily
- Sprint: 2 week duration
- Retrospectives: 1 hour on last day of sprint (team, no managers)
- Demos: 15min per team on last day of sprint
- Project planning: 1/2 day relative sizing with 6 months of stories (team and managers)
- Sprint planning: 2 hours on first day of new sprint (team and managers)
